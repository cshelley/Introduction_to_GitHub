### About Linked Issues and pull requests

Source:
<https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue>

You can link an issue to a pull request manually or using a supported
keyword in the pull request description. When you link a pull request to
the issue the pull request addresses, collaborators can see that someone
is working on the issue. The pull request will also reflect the issue
number, which will help keep track of pull requests. When you merge a
linked pull request into the default branch of a repository, it’s linked
issue is automatically closed.

To link the pull request to an issue, navigate to the issue you wish to
address. On the right-hand panel, click on “Create a branch” for this
issue or link a pull request.

You can now navigate to this new branch, which will begin with an
assigned Issue #. Upload your file addressing the issue and Commit
changes.
